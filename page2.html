           While growing up, I had two main hobbies: 
           <ul>
           <li>Gymnastics</li>
           <li>Swimming</li>
           </ul>
           I joined the teams at my school and also competed in both sports. 
           However, in recent years, I have not actively pursued any hobbies.
           Nevertheless, I have developed an interest in playing video games and baking.
