       My name is Fatimah, and I was born and raised in Kuwait, a country situated along the Arabian Gulf. 
       I have spent my entire life surrounded by my family, who play an essential and cherished role in my life.

       I have three sisters and one brother, all of whom contribute to making our home a lively and fulfilling place. 
       Growing up in a close-knit family has shaped my values and instilled in me the importance of support, connection, and gratitude. 
       Currently, I am a student at La Trobe College, taking a significant step forward in both my life and academic journey as I work towards building a bright future.
